## Abstract
In this Social Science Data Lab, I will give an introduction to the EFS Survey Software from Unipark (Questback). If you have never worked with the tool, then you will learn how to set up a first questionnaire to collect survey data over the Internet. We will discuss basic principals of participant recruitment, web questionnaire layout, and study design to conduct methodologically sound web surveys. This will also include taking into account the increasing number of respondents who participate in web surveys using their smartphone. For those who already have worked with Unipark before, we will have time to discuss more advanced features of the software such as working with quotas, lists, and loops.
